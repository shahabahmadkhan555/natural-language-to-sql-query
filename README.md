# natural-language-to-sql-query
1. Built a system that generates SQL queries when given simple conditional queries in english language.
2. Used Doc2Vec which is a semi-supervised algorithm to generate feature vectors from sentences.
3. Used Convolution Neural Network combined with Dense Neural Network to map input sentences to appropriate SQL queries.
4. Model achieved a highest 5-fold cross-validation score of 0.93
5. Tech stack used was Tensorflow, Doc2Vec library, Numpy, NLTK and Python.
